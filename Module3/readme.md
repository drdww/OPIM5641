# Welcome to Module 3!

Now that you know the basics of Python and that you know how to solve a linear program, it is time to delegate the task of solving linear programs to a Python module and start focusing on modeling, which is the most challenging and interesting part of the course and which will allow you to solve real-world problems efficiently. The learning process for modeling is very similar to the learning process for Math. You will see that creativity and insights are necessary sometimes, but there are several patterns that you will find frequently when solving real-world problems, and being able to identify such patterns will give you very strong modeling skills. Also, just like Math, the best way to learn how to detect and use these patterns is by doing exercises and making things work, and this is what we will start to do in this module. By the end of Module 3, you will learn some of the most important families of problems in optimization (allocation (packing), covering, and blending problems), you will see how to model them as linear programs, and you will learn how to translate a mathematical model into a Python code using Pyomo, a very easy and convenient Python library for optimization. After learning how to convert your model in code, you will use Pyomo to find the optimal solution for you (i.e., no need to solve problems by hand again). Linear programs have very interesting properties that allow us to generate Sensitivity Reports, which give us a lot of information about the problem (e.g., how the optimal value may change if we change certain parameters of the problem). In the end of this module, you will learn to generate and interpret Sensitivity Reports using Pyomo and GLPK, a linear programming solver that is used by Pyomo to solve linear programs.

# Objectives
