## Election
A political candidate is planning his media budget for an upcoming election.  He has $90,500 to spend.  His political consultants have provided him with the following estimates of additional votes as a result of the advertising effort:

* For every small sign placed by the roadside, he will garner 10 additional votes.
* For every large sign placed by the roadside, he will garner 30 additional votes.
* For every thousand bumper stickers placed on cars, he will garner 10 additional votes.
* For every hundred personal mailings to registered voters, he will garner 40 additional votes.
* For every radio ad heard daily in the last month before the election, he will garner 485 additional votes.

The cost for each of these advertising devices, along with the practical minimum and maximum that should be planned for each, are shown on the following table.  How should the candidate plan to spend his campaign money?
