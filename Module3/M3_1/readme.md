# Introduction to Linear Programming with Pyomo

## Objectives
* Gain confidence declaring decision variables, objectives and constraints with Pyomo
* Solve maximization and minimization problems with any number of decision variables and mixed constraints
* Convert fractions (blending constraints) into linear constraints
