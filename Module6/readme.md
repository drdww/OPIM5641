# Welcome to Module 6! (Nonlinear Optimization)
* M6_1: Warehouse location, curve fitting and regression
* M6_2: Portfolio allocation

Now that you know how to model linear programs and how to solve them using Python, you are able to solve a lot of interesting real-world problems. However, linear programming cannot be used to model every type of problem, as the real world is highly nonlinear. In this module, we will investigate the broader of nonlinear optimization problems; as the name suggests, linearity is not required from these models, so you will have a lot more freedom in terms of modeling. On the other hand, in many cases, the solution process becomes more challenging; in particular, when dealing with nonlinear problems you will not necessarily have optimality guarantees, i.e., the solution you will get after solving a nonlinear model may not be optimal. Also, the solution you will get for a problem may be different from the solution your friend got, even if both of you are using correct formulations. Things do not sound so nice, but there are some things you can do in order to improve your chances of getting high-quality solutions, and this is what you will learn in this module. Namely, by the end of this module, you should be able to model problems as nonlinear programs (which is easy, modeling problems as linear programs is more challenging) and to employ a few techniques that will allow you to identify very good solutions. Also, you will see how to separate the model from the data when creating your Pyomo models and how to employ data structures to create larger models; with that, it will be much easier for you to create larger models.

# Objectives:
By the end of this module, you should be able to:
* Model a problem as a nonlinear optimization model and solve it using Pyomo. Separate model from data and using data structures to create Pyomo models (for constraints/calculations).
* Understand the differences between local optimal solutions and global optimal solutions. Apply techniques to improve your chances of identifying global optimal solutions for nonlinear optimization problems
* Implement Monte Carlo simulation and interpret the output probabilistically
* Use real-time stock price data to allocate a portfolio and maximize returns for a given level of risk
