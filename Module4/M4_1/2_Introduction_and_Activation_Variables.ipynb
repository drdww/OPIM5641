        "We saw several examples where the optimal solutions (i.e., the values of the decision variables delivering the best objective value) were fractional numbers. However, in many practical examples, we would like these values to be integer.\n",

        "## Sometimes, Linear Programming gives us integer solutions\n",
        "\n",
        "In a few cases (very few, unfortunately), optimal LP solutions have integer values. For instance, we saw this happening when we solve certain types of  network problems (e.g., the shortest path problem). More generally, given a linear model with constraints $Ax \\leq b$, if \n",
        "$b$ contains only integer values and if $A$ is [totally unimodular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unimodular_matrix), then we know that the an optimal solution for this value will have all decision variables assigned to integer values (this is advanced material, you don't need to know this for this course).\n",
        "\n",
        "In most cases (virtually all interesting examples in practice, unfortunately), linear programs will give fractionary solutions. Therefore, we need to use **integer programming**, which is about models that force (some of the) variables to be integers.\n",

        "\n",
        "In practice, one will typically take a fractional solution and round the values so as to get something that makes physical sense. In practice, rounding is useful, but it can be problematic because:\n",
        "* It can lead to infeasible solutions\n",
        "* In some cases, there is no obvious rounding (e.g., choice variables are all equally distributed among the possible alternatives)\n",
        "* Rounded solutions may have very bad quality (i.e., they may be much worse than the actual optimal solution)\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why is Integer Programming nice?\n",

        "* Telecommunications (e.g., AT&T)\n",
        "* Advertising (e.g., MSNBC)\n",
        "IP is so important because in most real-world problems either **variables need to be integers**, or you need to satisfy a number of **logical constraints**, which may be formulated using **binary variables**, i.e., variables that can only be equal to 0 or to 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Is there any problem with Integer Programming?\n",
        "\n",
        "Yes, unfortunatelly, IPs are **much harder** to solve than LPs. In practice, some LP problems with millions of variables may be solved in minutes or seconds. On the other hand, certain IP problems with only 100 variables can take **years** (!!) to solve.\n",
        "\n",
        "## How do we solve Integer Programs?\n",

        "For this course, all you need to know is that Pyomo can use some solvers that can handle Integer Programs. Behind the curtains, these solvers check all possible assignments of integer values to variables (i.e., they perform a brute-force search). In some cases, they can infer that some combinations of values are not promising and do not need to be examined explicitly; coming up with the right inferences is the art behind these solvers.\n",
        "\n",
        "This procedure may require the solution of a large number of linear programs. This is done with the simplex algorithm, and the solvers will eventually locate a global optimum if we wait long enough for the solver to finish. Otherwise, they try to find a reasonable decent solution, eventually together with a gap between the solution it identified and some hypothetical optimal solution (this is advanced material; see the videos about \"Duality in Linear Programming\" if you want to understand more about it). \n",
