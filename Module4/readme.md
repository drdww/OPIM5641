# Welcome to Module 4! (Integer Programming)

This module is all about integer programming. At the highest level, integer programming can be used to ensure some or all decision variables must be integers - but it's WAY more exciting than that. For example, we can use binary variables to represent 'go/no go' decisions (like for strategic planning - select at least m projects, no more than n projects, contingency relationships, mutually exclusive relationships); the set covering problem (such as covering all locations with a minimal number of projects); or the use of linking constraints that ensure that if a 'go/no go' decision is made, it must be done at a certain level.

# Objectives:

By the end of this module, you should be able to:
* Change the domain of decision variables to force decision variables to take on integer values.
* Identify and define binary constraints and use them for project selection problems. 
* Identify and define fixed and variable costs, and use linking contraints to ensure consistency. 
* Use linking constraints to apply min/max thresholds and quantity discounts.

# Activities
You will be asked to complete the following required activities:
* Complete the readings and watch the videos/demos in Module 6.1
  * Complete the individual M6.1 Assignment
* Complete the readings and watch videos/demos in Module 6.2
* Review the Module 6 Summary to be sure you've achieved the learning objectives.
