# Introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis in Python

## Objectives:
* Read a .csv or Excel file from your Google Drive (mounting your Drive vs. downloading a link)
* Describe, summarize and visualize data in Python
* Enrich existing data with external sources (like Wikipedia and Github)
* Subset data based on a (logical) condition
* Create plots and tables by group using a for loop (to get more comfortable with loops)
