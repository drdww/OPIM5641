# Introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis in Python

## Objectives:
* Read a .csv or Excel file from your Google Drive (mounting your Drive vs. downloading a link)
* Retrieve attributes of a pandas dataframe
  * Shape (rows and columns), column names, column data types  
* Create a new column (feature engineering)
  * Logical (flag) column/recoding values 
* Describe, summarize and visualize data in Python
* Enrich existing data with external sources (like Wikipedia and Github)
* Subset data based on a (logical) condition
  * by integer location (.iloc), by name (.loc)
  * And (&) vs. Or (|) 
* Make basic univariate plots and bivariate plots with titles, axis titles, ylim/xlim, colors, markers
  * Univariate: histogram, kernel density plot, boxplot
  * Bivariate: scatter plot
  * Adding lines, text and arrows to plots
* Create plots and tables by group using a for loop (to get more comfortable with loops)
