# Welcome to Module 1!

This module is all about getting your feet wet - we will cover topics such as introducing Python language coding basics, exploratory data analysis (plots, tables and data wrangling), and an introduction to solving optimizations in Python using 'brute force' (essentially, a bunch of for loops) and why this 'brute force' method leaves a lot to be desired (spoiler alert: it is INCREDIBLY inefficient! ...things can only go up from here.)


## Objectives
By the end of this module, you should be able to:

* Develop well-designed Colab notebooks (organized layout, text cells with beautiful formatting; code cells with lots of comments)
* Solve optimization problems in Python using the 'brute force' method
* Describe, summarize and visualize data in Python
* Enrich existing data with external sources (like Wikipedia and Github)


## Activities
You will be asked to complete the following required activities:

* Complete the readings and watch the videos/demos in Module 1.1
  * Complete the M1.1 Individual Assignment
* Complete the readings and watch the videos/demos in Module 1.2
  * Complete the M1.2 Individual Assignment
* Review the Module 1 Summary to be sure you've achieved the learning objectives
