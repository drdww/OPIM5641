# Activities

Here is a fun ice breaker - can check in on a few during class (have students join the WebEx and share their screen). Take 15 minutes to do the following...
* Make a Colab notebook with a nice header, subheader, bold font, italic font, emoji, code cell, text cell, embedded picture, and the following bullets:
  * Name
  * Nickname (optional)
  * Where you are from
  * Undergrad major
  * Grad major (and concentration)
  * Python skill level (newbie, some skills, expert)
  * What you hope to get out of the class
  * What you hope to do once you graduate
  * A fun fact about yourself
