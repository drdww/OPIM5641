# The 'Brute Force' Algorithm

## Objectives
* Time your script using `autotime` (and show how print statements can slow down the execution of a for loop!)
* Identify the key components of a brute force optimization (objective function, decision variables, objective function coefficients, constraints)
* Understand and use nested for loops (one for each decision variable)
* Create placeholders to store results (overwrite them as the objective function improves)
* Use error handling to deal with infeasible solutions (`break` and `continue`)
* State the pros and cons of the brute-force algorithm
