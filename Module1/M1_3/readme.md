# Probability Distributions, Monte Carlo Simulations and For Loops

Let's add an awesome notebook on for loops and dictionaries vs. lists...

## Objectives
* Describe and use the common discrete distributions (binomial, uniform, Poisson)
* Tell the difference between a probability density (mass) function and cumulative density (mass) function
* Describe and use the common continuous distributions (normal, triangular, uniform) 
* Create one or more samples from a given distribution
* Use for loops to conduct Monte Carlo simulations
* Visualize, tabulate and describe results from Monte Carlo simulation
