# Welcome to Module 5! (Network Problems)

This module is all about network problems. Drawing the network as a system of arcs and nodes can help analysts better understand the business problem at hand. The transportation model (minimum cost flow - like shipping goods through a supply chain for the lowest cost), the assignment model (assign N people to do N jobs - applications for machine scheduling tasks), and the trans-shipment problem (a two-stage transportation model, where we use balance equations) are all introductory examples of how to allocate supply to meet demand. However - things can get complicated quickly - if demand exceeds supply, we will need to make a virtual supply node to help cover the extra demand. We will extend this concept of network models to address reductions in flow (like furnishing 100 tons of raw material into 10 tons of finished goods) and expansions in flow (how to allocate your investments to pay for college or retire as a millionaire.)

# Objectives
By the end of this module, you should be able to:
* Conceptualize, draw and solve the transportation problem (where supply >= demand) for a minimum cost flow example.
* Generalize the transportation model to a two-stage trans-shipment problem (requires a compound objective function).
* Conceptualize, draw and solve the 'reduction in flow' example (where demand > supply) and the 'expansion in flow' example (also known as 'laddering' in the finance world).
* Apply simulation and Monte Carlo simulation techniques to network problems.

# Activities
You will be asked to complete the following required activities:
* Complete the readings and watch the videos/demos in Module 5.1
  * Complete the individual M5.1 Assignment
* Complete the readings and watch the videos/demos in Module 5.2
* Review the Module 5 Summary to be sure you've achieved the learning objectives.
