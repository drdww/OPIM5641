# Welcome to Module 2!

This module is all about the mathematical building blocks of linear programming problems. Rather than just pushing a button and hoping that Python or Excel will spit out an optimal solution to the problem it is solving, let's slow it down and dig into the guts of 'how' the model is finding the optimal solution. You will learn how to translate a business problem into a mathematical model with an objective function, decision variables and constraints. Then you will learn how to plot constraints (which are similar to lines on a 2D plane) and shade out areas where the constraint is infeasible. After repeating this for each constraint, you will identify the feasible region and evaluate the model at the corner points of the 2D feasible region using the graphical method. The graphical method applies to 2D maximization problems (like maximizing profit) and minimization problems (like minimizing cost or time). If we have more than two decision variables, the graphical method can't be used - instead, we will rely on the Simplex algorithm which can handle maximization problems (with all less than or equal to constraints) and minimization problems (all greater than or equal to constraints). You will continue to make beautiful, well-organized Colab notebooks and are well on your way to solving some incredibly cool and useful business problems.
